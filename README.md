# Visitor Pattern Example: Museum Tour

## Introduction

The Visitor Pattern defines a way to add new behaviors or operations (represented by different types of visitors) to a collection of elements (exhibits in a museum) without altering their structures. Each visitor implements specific operations for different types of exhibits, enabling diverse interactions between visitors and exhibits.

## Real-world Analogy

In the context of a museum tour, the Visitor Pattern mirrors how various types of visitors (concrete visitors) interact with different exhibits (concrete elements) in the museum. Each visitor brings a unique perspective or expertise, applying specific operations when encountering various exhibits without changing the exhibits themselves.

## Components

### Visitor Interface (TourGuide)

- Defines visit methods corresponding to different exhibit types.
- Visitors (concrete classes) implement these methods to perform specific actions on exhibits.

### Concrete Visitors (ArtEnthusiast, Historian, RestorationExpert)

- Implement the TourGuide interface, representing different types of museum visitors.
- Each concrete visitor performs specific actions or operations when visiting different types of exhibits.

### Element Interface (Exhibit)

- Defines the accept method accepting a visitor as an argument.
- Exhibits (concrete elements) implement this method to allow visitors to interact with them.

### Concrete Elements (Painting, Sculpture, Artifact)

- Implement the Exhibit interface and invoke the visitor's visit method based on their type.

## Usage

1. Create different types of visitors (e.g., ArtEnthusiast, Historian).
2. Instantiate exhibits (e.g., Painting, Sculpture, Artifact).
3. Allow visitors to interact with exhibits by calling the accept method on exhibits.

## Implementation Notes

- Extend the example by adding more concrete visitors and exhibits to showcase diverse interactions.
- Ensure each exhibit accepts different types of visitors while performing specific operations based on the visitor type.
